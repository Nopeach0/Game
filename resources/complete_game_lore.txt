====================
ASHES OF AETHERON - COMPLETE LORE
====================

MAIN LORE
---------
The world of Aetheron was once whole, a land where **life, death, and rebirth** flowed in harmony,
bound together by the **Veil of Samsara**. But ambition shattered balance.

A king named **Kroneth** and a false prophet called **Mara** tore the veil apart. 
Their lust for immortality brought chaos: spirits could no longer return to the cycle. 
Souls lingered, and the world rotted. Gods abandoned Aetheron, except for one, 
**Ananta**, the Great Serpent, guardian of the endless cycle. 

In his final act, Ananta branded a mortal with the **Mark of the Cycle**, you.
Through you, the broken circle might be restored.

INTRODUCTION (Starting Text)
---------
"You awaken beneath skies the color of burnt bone. Ash clings to your skin, and the earth beneath you
is warm with the fading memory of fire. In your palm lies a sigil, a serpent devouring its own tail,
etched into your flesh. You do not know your name. You do not know why you are here. Only the whisper
of an old god coils around your thoughts:

    'Restore the Cycle... or drown in the flames of your own making.'

The trees around you breathe like dying lungs. Far to the east, a golden mountain pierces the heavens,
its peak swallowed by storms. To the west, ruins of temples and bones of forgotten kings sleep beneath
a sea of fog. You feel them watching you, waiting."

THE QUEST
---------
Your journey will take you through the broken remains of Aetheron:
1. **The Forest of Silence**, Where you awaken.
2. **Wat Thamai Ruins**, Fallen temples haunted by Yaksha guardians.
3. **Samsara Spiral**, A labyrinth of time, where death is never the end.
4. **Mount Suthanok**, Home to the last Flame of Stillness, where gods once walked.

You must recover the three **Fangs of Ananta** and confront those who shattered the veil.
Each Fang unlocks a fragment of your own lost memory, revealing the truth of your birth.

MYSTERY OF THE PLAYER
---------
You are not merely a mortal.
You are **the last fragment of Ananta's soul**, reborn into flesh. 
Your choices are not just for the world, but for yourself. 
Will you restore the cycle, or seize control of it?

ENDING CHOICES
--------------

ENDING 1: RESTORE THE CYCLE (True Ending)
-----------------------------------------
Atop Mount Suthanok, the storm quiets as you face **Kroneth Bound in Gold** and **Mara’s Whisper**.
After the battle, the final Fang fuses with your soul. 
Ananta speaks through you:

    "The cycle turns once more."

Your body dissolves into starlight. The Veil of Samsara is restored. 
The souls of the dead find peace. The world forgets you, but balance returns.

ENDING TEXT:
"You vanish into the endless sky, leaving behind a silent, healed world. 
Your story ends where all stories must — within the turning wheel."

---

ENDING 2: SEIZE THE CYCLE (Dark Ending)
---------------------------------------
With the Fangs united, you refuse to restore the cycle. 
Instead, you shatter the last barrier and bind the world’s soul to yourself.
You become **the new god of Aetheron**.

ENDING TEXT:
"The wheel does not turn. It breaks.
The souls of Aetheron now orbit you, their hollow master.
A new age begins, not of balance — but of stillness, under your rule."

---

ENDING 3: FAIL (Bad Ending)
---------------------------
If you fall to Kroneth and Mara before uniting the Fangs, the last flame dies.

ENDING TEXT:
"The ash grows cold. The serpent sleeps forever. 
Aetheron collapses into silence, devoured by the void."

---

EPILOGUE
--------
No one will remember your name.
Only the choice you made.
And in the whisper of the wind, the faintest hiss of a serpent endures.
