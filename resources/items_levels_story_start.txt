===== Main Story: “Ashes of Aetheron” =====

The world of Aetheron lies broken.

Once a land where spirit and matter danced in harmony, it was shattered when the **Veil of Samsara** was torn by greedy kings and false prophets. Now, the cycle of life and death is fractured. Spirits linger. Rebirth is lost. Monsters rise from forgotten karma.

You awaken in the **Forest of Silence**, your memory gone — except a single vision: a colossal serpent coiling around a burning tree, whispering, “_Restore the cycle, or drown in flame._”

You are marked by the ancient god **Ananta**, a remnant of balance now fading.

To restore the world, you must:
1. Reignite the **Flame of Stillness** atop Mount Suthanok.
2. Traverse the **Samsara Spiral** and reclaim the three **Fangs of Ananta**.
3. Face **Kroneth, Bound in Gold**, and **Mara’s Whisper**, the ones who broke the Veil.
4. Choose: **Restore the cycle... or control it.**

===== Starting Text for Player =====

"You awaken beneath ash-heavy skies, the ground still warm with the memory of fire. 
In your palm lies a symbol — a serpent devouring its own tail.

Voices echo from the trees, and time feels fractured. The world has forgotten you — yet something old remembers.

Walk the forgotten path, seeker. The cycle awaits."
